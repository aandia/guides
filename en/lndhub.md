LNDhub allows you to easily import a wallet into compatible applications. While you can save your Bitcoin Txoko LNbits wallet to your phone as a progressive web app (PWA), a native app like [Zeus](https://zeusln.app/) or [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) offers a better user experience and better security. With [Alby](https://getalby.com/), you can also import the wallet into your browser extension for easy Lightning on the web and for Nostr zaps. It's possible to import your LNbits wallet into Zeus, BlueWallet, Alby or BTCPay Server with [LNDhub](https://github.com/BlueWallet/LndHub/tree/master). We will cover how to do it with Alby and Zeus in this guide. With the Alby setup, one of the steps will easily allow you to import your wallet into Zeus as well. But if you only want to import your wallet into Zeus, you can skip to the Zeus section. 
### Alby
Alby is a browser extension that brings Lightning and Nostr to your browser. Using the [WebLN](https://www.webln.dev/) protocol, the extension can easily detect invoices on webpages and pay them as well as let you sign into websites with Lightning. You can also set budgets for your favourite Lightning sites. Furthermore, it can act as a Nostr signer using [NIP-07](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/07.md), which is much more secure than entering your private key into web clients. 
#### What do I need? 
- Web browser that supports Chrome or Firefox extensions. [Kiwi Browser](https://kiwibrowser.com/) supports it on Android. 
- Access to your LNbits wallet. If you do not have a LNbits wallet yet, head over to [our wallet page](https://bitcointxoko.com) and create one. Make sure you save your wallet link so that you can come back to it later!
- (Optional) A mobile device for setting up Zeus. 
#### 1. Enable the LNDhub extension on your LNbits wallet
In your browser, head over to your wallet link. Click on *Extensions* and enable the *LNDhub* extension. After it has been enabled, go to the LNDhub extension page.

ðŸ’¡ You can choose between invoice URL and admin URL. They give Alby different permissions to interact with your LNbits wallet.

- Admin URL also allows you to send payments. 
#### 4. (Optional) Set up Zeus with Alby
Now that you have connected your LNbits with Alby, you can also easily import it into Zeus with Alby. Simply open the extension, click on your wallet name, and go to Account Settings. Under **Account** you can find the option to *Connect your mobile wallet*. When you press *Connect*, you will be shown a QR code to scan from Zeus. 

If you haven't installed Zeus previously, go to [zeusln.app](https://zeusln.app/) and download Zeus for your mobile operating system. 

Once Zeus has been downloaded, go to *Settings -> Add a new node*. Here you can scan the QR code that Alby is showing to import the wallet. 

VoilÃ ! Now you have the power of Lightning at your fingertips. Do you feel like a god yet?
